# JeffrOS
I'm trying to make a very simple botched together Operating System.
<br> This is a hobby project so don't expect any good code or professionalism.
Especially since I'm very new to C++.

The name is a combination of Jeffrey (not my name though) and OS.

### Contains few basic functionalities:
  - VGA text driver
  - unfinished string and math library
  - interrupt handling (IRQ's are planned)

### Planned features:
  - A way of debugging
  - Timer driver
  - VGA graphics driver
  - Keyboard driver (PS/2)
  - Disk driver + some file system
  - Memory management (probably very important but idk what to use it for myself yet)
  - Shell
  - very simple GUI
  
#### Possible features:
  - Audio Driver
  - Mouse Driver
  - USB Keyboard driver <br>
(Following things are very unsure)
  - PCI & PCIE driver 
  - Networking
  - UEFI
  - 64-bit implementation


I might change the build script to a make file... <br>
I also might not. <br>
It might be inefficient but a shell script is good enough for now.
  

contains some copied code because I am not a good programmer and I want to do as much as I can in high level languages.
